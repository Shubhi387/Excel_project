# Coffee Sales Dashboard

Steps for Creating the Dashboard
1. Choose a New File and Import Data
    Start by creating a new Excel file.
    Import the data in CSV format.
    Use the Query Editor to load the data into the Excel workbook. This tool helps in managing data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
2. Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)
    With the data loaded into Excel, perform the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process using Power Query.
    Ensure that the data is clean, relevant, and properly structured for further analysis.
3. Using XLOOKUP to Fill Missing Data
    Use the XLOOKUP function to locate and retrieve the missing values across various columns.
    This helps in completing the dataset where values are not immediately visible or missing.
4. Using INDEX Function for Remaining Values
    For values that were still incomplete or need precise referencing, I used the INDEX function.
    This function helps in retrieving values from a specific location within a range.
5. Using IF Functions to Update Shortened Names
    Implement the IF function to convert short form component names into their full version.
    This ensures clarity and consistency in naming conventions across the dataset.
6. Date Formatting
    Format date columns to ensure consistency and proper readability.
    This step ensures that dates are in the correct format for analysis and reporting.
7. Number Formatting
    Apply number formatting to ensure all numeric values are presented clearly.
    This enhances readability and accuracy of the data.
8. Check for Duplicates
    Identify and remove any duplicate rows or entries to ensure the data set remains accurate and reliable.
    This is crucial for clean reporting and analysis.
9. Convert Range to Table
    Convert the data range into a Table format for easier manipulation and analysis.
    This step also makes it easier to update and manage data.
10. Add Pivot Tables and Charts
    Insert various Pivot Tables to summarize the data effectively.
    Use Pivot Charts to visualize the key insights from the data.
11. Format Pivot Tables and Charts
    Customize the appearance of the Pivot Tables and Charts for a more visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard.
12. Insert Timelines and Slicers
    Add Timeline and Slicer controls to provide interactivity to the dashboard.
    This allows users to filter data by different time periods or categories.
13. Update Pivot Table Data Source
    Ensure the Pivot Table data source is up to date after any changes to the underlying data.
14. Build the Dashboard
    Once all necessary data manipulations and visualizations are complete, use the Dashboard sheet to combine all elements into one cohesive and interactive dashboard.
# Technologies Used:
